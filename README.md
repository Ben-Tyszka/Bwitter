# Bwitter
## About
Bwitter is a Twitter web clone. It is written in Typescript with the React.js framework. All backend services are handled with Google's Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) solution called Firebase.
## Some personal and project goals
+ Create a professional, production level web application using modern web technologies
+ More specifically, I want to learn advanced React and Typescript development and play with Firebase
+ Make the application mobile compatible
+ Demonstrate my proficiency in ES6, TS, and programming in general
+ Write **clean** and **maintainable** code
+ Hopefully start following test driven development standards
+ Create an modern looking app using material design
## Current roadmap
+ [ ] Boilerplate auth (~~login~~, ~~registration~~, deletion, password reset, ~~auth detection~~)
+ [ ] Profile features (~~username~~,~~avatar~~, ~~bio~~, link in bio, following)
+ [ ] **Basic** tweet feature (you can tweet and view a timeline of your followers tweets tweets)
