# Bwitter
## About
Bwitter is a Twitter web clone. It is written in Typescript with Facebook's React framework. The backend is handled inside the Google Cloud through varying Firebase services.
## Project goals
+ Create a professional, production level web application using modern web technologies
+ Have no points of refresh
+ Have a mobile compatible web app
+ Use only Typescript (.tsx and .ts) and have the app be 100% typesafe (Thunk is making that last point really hard ðŸ˜ )
+ Write **clean** and **maintainable** code
+ Follow test driven development standards
+ Create an modern looking app using material design
## Current roadmap
+ [ ] Boilerplate auth (~~login~~, ~~registration~~, ~~deletion~~, password reset, ~~auth detection~~, email verification)
+ [ ] Profile features (~~username~~,~~avatar~~, ~~bio~~, link in bio, following)
+ [ ] **Basic** tweet feature (you can tweet and view a timeline of your followers tweets tweets)
